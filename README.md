Screen capture tray application

Initial plan is to create application that creates snapshots of the active window or full screen.
Application will be running in windows tray.

Functionality:
- full screen snapshots
- active window snapshots
- window tracking snapshots - tracking window by it's handle
- periodical snapshots i.e. every 10 sec
- audio recording - so you can record snapshots and audio from ie. webinars

TODO:
1. Fix file name logging issue
2. Add auto capture option when app starts 
3. Start in tray option
4. Add audio recording options
5. Add MP3 format
