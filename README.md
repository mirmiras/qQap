Screen capture tray application

Initial plan is to create application that creates snapshots of the active window or full screen.
Application will be running in windows tray.

Functionality:
- full screen snapshots
- active window snapshots
- window tracking snapshots - tracking window by it's handle
- periodical snapshots i.e. every 10 sec
- audio recording - you can record snapshots and audio from ie. webinars

TODO:
1. Add auto capture option when app starts 
2. Start in tray option
3. Add audio recording options
4. Add MP3 format
5. Window by handler tracking
